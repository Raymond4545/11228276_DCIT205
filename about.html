    Computing and computer technology has infiltrated every aspect of our lives. <br>
    For instance, we can work, shop, and play at the click of a button,<br>
     because computer science has made it possible. <br>
     So what is computer science? Why is it important?<br>
      And is it a promising career? According to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS),<br> 
      overall employment in computer and information technology occupations will grow by 15% between 2021 and 2031.<br>
       That makes it even more important for you to understand ‘what is computer science’ so that you can decide whether<br>
        you want to pursue a career in that field. <br><br><br>
   
   
   
    The range of courses available in the department and the skills acquired
     by students enable them to find employment in many diverse fields of the economy 
     and prepare our graduates for the computing industry, working in a project team (or research
      and development team), and to enable the graduate to bring specialist skills to that team. 
      The course also provides the platform for further study or research through exposure to established and emerging technologies and methods,
       and to active fields of research in Computer Science.

The Department offers two undergraduate degree programmes, Bachelor of Science in Computer Science Single-Major (3:2:1:1) and Major-Minor (3:2:2:1)
 as well as Bachelor of Science in Information Technology.
 We offer short courses  which is open to senior high school graduates,tertiary students,graduates and the general public. This is an eight week intensive certificate course
